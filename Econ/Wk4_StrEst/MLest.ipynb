    "The Jupyter Notebook entitled [Root Finders and Minimizers in Python](https://github.com/OpenSourceMacro/BootCamp2017/blob/master/Tutorials/PythonRootMin.ipynb) provides a good tutorial for how to implement a minimizer in Python. A minimizer is a function that chooses a single value or a vector of values to minimize the result of a scalar-valued function of that vector. Any maximization problem can be restated as a minimization problem. Because minimization problems are more numerically stable and well defined, most numerical optimizers are stated as minimizers. The [scipy.optimize](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.18.1/reference/optimize.html) library has many types of root-finders and minimizers. For our maximum likelihood estimation problems, we will use the [scipy.optimize.minimize()](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.18.1/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html#scipy.optimize.minimize) function."

That is, we want to know what is the variance or uncertainty of our estimates for $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$, and how are those two estimates correlated. The four most common estimators for the VCV matrix of a maximum likelihood estimate are:\n",

The Hessian matrix therefore captures information about how the slope of the log likelihood function is changing in each direction.The empirical Hessian estimator is the most commonly used. One really nice property of Python's `minimize()` function is that one of the result objects is the inverse Hessian.\n",
