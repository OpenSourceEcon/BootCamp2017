    "## 1. MLE vs. GMM: Strengths and weaknesses\n",
    "A paper by Fuhrer, et al (1995) studies the accuracy and efficiency of the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator versus the generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator in the context of a simple linear-quadratic inventory model. They find that ML has some very nice properties over GMM in small samples when the model is simple. In the spirit of the Fuhrer, et al (1995) paper, we list the strengths and weaknesses of MLE vs. GMM more generally. I recommend you read the introduction to Fuhrer, et al (1995)."

    "## 2. The GMM estimator\n",
    "GMM was first formalized by Hansen (1982). A strength of GMM estimation is that the econometrician can remain completely agnostic as to the distribution of the random variables in the DGP. For identification, the econometrician simply needs at least as many moment conditions from the data as he has parameters to estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *moment* of the data is broadly defined as any statistic that summarizes the data to some degree. A data moment could be as narrow as an individual observation from the data or as broad as the sample average. GMM estimates the parameters of a model or data generating process to make the model moments as close as possible to the corresponding data moments. See Davidson and MacKinnon (2004, ch. 9) for a more detailed treatment of GMM. The estimation methods of linear least squares, nonlinear least squares, generalized least squares, and instrumental variables estimation are all specific cases of the more general GMM estimation method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $m(x)$ be an $R\\times 1$ vector of moments from the real world data $x$. And let $x$ be an $N\\times K$ matrix of data with $K$ columns representing $K$ variables and $N$ observations. Let the model DGP be characterized as $F(x,\\theta)$, where $F$ is a vector of equations, each of which is a function of the data $x$ and the $K\\times 1$ parameter vector $\\theta$. Then define $m(x|\\theta)$ as a vector of $R$ moments from the model that correspond to the real-world moment vector $m(x)$. Note that GMM requires both real world data $x$ and deterministic moments from the model $m(x|\\theta)$ in order to estimate $\\hat{\\theta}_{GMM}$. There is also a stochastic way to generate moments from the model, which we discuss later in our section on Simulated Method of Moments (SMM).\n",

    "The distance measure $||m(x|\\theta)-m(x)||$ can be any kind of norm. But it is important to recognize that your estimates $\\hat{\\theta}_{GMM}$ will be dependent on what distance measure (norm) you choose. The most widely studied and used distance metric in GMM estimation is the $L^2$ norm or the sum of squared errors in moments. Define the moment error function $e(x|\\theta)$ as the percent difference in the vector of model moments from the data moments.\n",

This ensures that the problem is scaled properly and does not suffer from ill conditioning.\n",

The $R\\times R$ weighting matrix $W$ in the criterion function allows the econometrician to control how each moment is weighted in the minimization problem. For example, an $R\\times R$ identity matrix for $W$ would give each moment equal weighting, and the criterion function would be a simply sum of squared percent deviations (errors). Other weighting strategies can be dictated by the nature of the problem or model."

    "## 5. Identification\n",
    "An issue that we saw in the examples from the previous section is that there is some science as well as some art in choosing moments to identify the parameters in a GMM estimation. Suppose the parameter vector $\\theta$ has $K$ elements, or rather, $K$ parameters to be estimated. In order to estimate $\\theta$ by GMM, you must have at least as many moments as parameters to estimate $R\\geq K$. If you have exactly as many moments as parameters to be estimated $R=K$, the model is said to be *exactly identified*. If you have more moments than parameters to be estimated $R>K$, the model is said to be *overidentified*. If you have fewer moments than parameters to be estimated $R<K$, the model is said to be *underidentified*. There are good reasons to overidentify $R>K$ the model in GMM estimation as we saw in the previous example. The main reason is that not all moments are orthogonal. That is, some moments convey roughly the same information about the data and, therefore, do not separately identify any extra parameters. So a good GMM model often is overidentified $R>K$.\n",
    "\n",
    "One last point about GMM regards moment selection and verification of results. The real world has an infinite supply of potential moments that describe some part of the data. Choosing moments to estimate parameters by GMM requires understanding of the model, intuition about its connections to the real world, and artistry. A good GMM estimation will include moments that have some relation to or story about their connection to particular parameters of the model to be estimated. In addition, a good verification of a GMM estimation is to take some moment from the data that was not used in the estimation and see how well the corresponding moment from the estimated model matches that *outside moment*."

    "## 6. Linear regression by GMM\n",
    "The most common method of estimating the parameters of a linear regression is using the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator. This estimator is just special type of generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator. A simple regression specification in which the dependent variable $y_i$ is a linear function of two independent variables $x_{1,i}$ and $x_{2,i}$ is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1,i} + \\beta_2 x_{2,i} + \\varepsilon_i \\quad\\text{where}\\quad \\varepsilon_i\\sim N\\left(0,\\sigma^2\\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we can solve for the parameters $(\\beta_0,\\beta_1,\\beta_2)$ in a number of ways. And we can do it without making any assumptions about the distribution of the error terms $\\varepsilon_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way we might choose the parameters is to choose $(\\beta_0,\\beta_1,\\beta_2)$ to minimize the distance between the $N$ observations of $y_i$ and the $N$ predicted values for $y_i$ given by $\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1,i} + \\beta_2 x_{2,i}$. You can think of the $N$ observations of $y_i$ as $N$ data moments. And you can think of the $N$ observations of $\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1,i} + \\beta_2 x_{2,i}$ as $N$ model moments. The least squares estimator minimizes the sum of squared errors, which is the sum of squared deviations between the $N$ values of $y_i$ and  $\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1,i} + \\beta_2 x_{2,i}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\varepsilon_i = y_i - \\beta_0 - \\beta_1 x_{1,i} - \\beta_2 x_{2,i} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat{\\theta}_{OLS} = \\theta:\\quad \\min_{\\theta} \\varepsilon^T\\, I \\, \\varepsilon $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let the $N\\times 1$ vector of $y_i$'s be $Y$. Let the $N\\times 3$ vector of data $(1, x_{1,i}, x_{2,i})$ be $X$. And let the vector of three parameters $(\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\beta_2)$ be $\\beta$. It can be shown that the OLS estimator for the vector of parameters $\\beta$ is the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat{\\beta}_{OLS} = (X^T X)^{-1}(X^T Y) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "But you could also just estimate the coefficients using the criterion function in the GMM statement of the problem above. This method is called nonlinear least squares or generalized least squares. Many applications of regression use a weighting matrix in the criterion function that adjusts for issues like heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, many applications use a different distance metric than the weighted sum of squared errors for the difference in moments. Sum of squared errors puts a large penalty on big differences. Sometimes you might want to maximize the sum of absolute errors, which is sometimes called median regression. You could also minimize the maximum absolute difference in the errors, which is even more extreme than the sum of squared errors on penalizing large differences."
